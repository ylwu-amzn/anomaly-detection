Client -> "REST API Handler": start historical detector
"REST API Handler" -> "TransportAction": start historical detector

"TransportAction" --> "REST API Handler": task id
"REST API Handler" --> Client: task id

"TaskManager" -> "RemoteTransportAction": dispatch task to worker node
note right
 It's possible to run locally
 Just use remote execution as example
end note
"RemoteTransportAction" --> "TaskManager": status: ok
"RemoteTransportAction" -> "BatchTaskRunner": run task

loop run piece by piece until reach the end date
    "BatchTaskRunner" -> "FeatureManager": query feature data by batch
    "FeatureManager" --> "BatchTaskRunner": aggregated feature data
    "BatchTaskRunner" -> "RCF&Threshold Model": train model&get anomaly result
    "RCF&Threshold Model" --> "BatchTaskRunner": anomaly result
    "BatchTaskRunner" -> "BatchTaskRunner": persist anomaly result
    "BatchTaskRunner" -> "BatchTaskRunner": update task state/progress
